          **Hi! I'm Sebastian and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer Jr. looking
          for my first job!. I'm so happy to have the possibility to apply it in
          conjunction with all the technologies that I learned in the Argentinian Henry
          Bootcamp, where I formed myself with their intensive course for
          Full-Stack Web Developer, which counts with many and many hours of
          practicing and learning. °°Which technologies do I work with?<br/>
          
          ◾Languages: Javascript, SQL, MongoDb <br/>◾Front-End : React | Redux |
          Hooks | React-Router | Bootstrap | CSS | HTML | Bootstrap ◾Back-End :
          Node.js | Express | Moongose ◾DataBase: SEQUELIZE | PostgreSQL |
          SQLite | MongoDb. <br/>◾Metodologias: SCRUM ◾GIT | GITHUB <br/> As a Full-Stack,
          I know how to perform myself in both, Front-End as much as Back-End
          sides of the development. Currently, I'm looking forward to having my
          first opportunity to work with pairs who have the same passion for the
          It world as me and to continue learning new technologies and facing
          new challenges.
